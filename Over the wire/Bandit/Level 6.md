so this time they  gave three hint that the file is a human readable file ,1033 bytes in size , not executable so 
1) i went in and typed ls in home directory to find a inhere folder in it
2) then i typed ls and found a lot of maybehere folders containg many files ewith name .file
3) so i could have used trial and error for finding the right folder but i would take a lot of time
4) But i used the clue and went back to the home directory ~ and used
```

5) file inhere/*
```


6) then i started using some options of it like sort the list based on sizes and etc but i couldnt find it 
7) then i tried using find command and used -size and -type to find the right file and found it to be present in the maybehere07/.file2
