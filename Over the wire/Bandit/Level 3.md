so in this level the filename is given by some spaces in its name itself so we cant access it by usual method if we try to use it will take name as different arguments 

so to access these there are two method :


Wrap the entire filename between quotes:

```
"file name withn spaces"
```
 
 or
 
Escape every space using backslash key:

```
file\ name\ with\ spaces
```

so i used the first method and got the password for next one
