Using `ls` we can see a README.txt file in the home directory. Catting this file will give a congratulation message.

```shell
bandit33@bandit:~$ cat README.txt
Congratulations on solving the last level of this game!

At this moment, there are no more levels to play in this game. However, we are constantly working
on new levels and will most likely expand this game with more levels soon.
Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels!
In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames.

If you have an idea for an awesome new level, please let us know!

The end!
