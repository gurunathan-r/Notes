The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **port 30001 on localhost** using SSL encryption.

**Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…**

```
bandit15@melinda:~$ openssl s_client -ign_eof -connect localhost:30001
...[redacted]...
SSL-Session:
    ...[redacted]...
    Verify return code: 18 (self signed certificate)
