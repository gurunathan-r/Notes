so this time they  gave hint that the password is associated with the word "millionth" so 
1) i went in and typed ls in home directory to find data.txt
2) then i used 
```
3) cat data.txt
```
 4) Then it gave a lot of words associated with some words in it 
 5) then i tried using grep with -i with the word 
```
 6) grep -i "millionth" data.txt
```
the got the code

the below code is the second time as my first terminal crashed due to the long words from cat
