so this time they also gave a hint that the file is a readable file so its time to use file command
1) i went in and typed ls in home directory to find a inhere folder in it
2) then i typed ls and i found a lot of dashed files
3) so i could have used trial and error for finding answer
4) But i used the clue and went back to the home directory ~ and used
```
5) file inhere/*
```
   6) then i found -file07 was a ascii text file which is human readable
   7) so i went to inhere and opened the file by    
```
cat ./file07
```
 then found the password
